For my final project, I succeeded in implementing my first goal, but
unfortunately I'm still in the process of debugging the second goal.

## Building and Running

The instructions to build and run are identical to those for Assignment 3. This
may change once I upload the OpenMP portions shortly.


## Results


### Part 1

My first goal was to implement the Approximate Agglomerate Clustering algorithm
for BVH build acceleration. This algorithm sacrifices potential build quality
for locally optimal decisions. Here are some of the results I've been able to
achieve so far.

`./pathtracer ../dae/sky/blob.dae`

| Algorithm (Max Leaf Size) | Build Time | Render Time |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Recursive SAH (4)         | 2.0232 sec | 28.9634 sec |
| Serial AAC (4)            | 0.8198 sec | 87.8281 sec |
| Serial AAC (20)           | 1.5859 sec | 34.9350 sec |

`./pathtracer ../dae/meshedit/beast.dae`

| Algorithm (Max Leaf Size) | Build Time | Render Time |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Recursive SAH (4)         | 0.5662 sec |  3.0803 sec |
| Serial AAC (4)            | 0.2887 sec |  7.1478 sec |
| Serial AAC (30)           | 0.6130 sec |  3.0214 sec |

`./pathtracer ../dae/meshedit/cow.dae`

| Algorithm (Max Leaf Size) | Build Time | Render Time |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Recursive SAH (4)         | 0.0372 sec |  2.3346 sec |
| Serial AAC (4)            | 0.0183 sec |  3.7988 sec |
| Serial AAC (30)           | 0.0472 sec |  2.6320 sec |


### Part 2

My second goal was to parallelize the serial AAC algorithm to make it even
faster. Unfortunately as of the time of this writing, this algorithm does not
run without error. I plan on fixing it and submitting promptly. If it is not too
much to ask, I'd appreciate it if you could check back again in a day or so.

So that you can build the code as it is right now, I've only submitted the code
checked out at the serial implementation. I will update this with the parallel
code.

Sorry for the inconveniences (final week is hard D:)


## Takeaway

The general trend seems to be that the build time is definitely faster, but at
the cost of render times, which is unfortunately not a winning tradeoff. The
good news is that we could potentially use this algorithm if what we really
needed was short build times.

This could potentially be the case where we're trying to render a really low
quality scene in a game. In these circumstances, we might care more about
_correctness_ ("is there an object in front of me or not?") versus _quality_
("is this scene beautifully detailed?").

## Future Work

The paper obviously reported more impressive results than those I've described
here. This could be due to a number of reasons.

First of all, test scenes might have been more primitive-dense, i.e., more
primitives concentrated in a given volume. These types of scenes would be more
amenable to this type of algorithm (parallelism).

The paper itself suggests a number of tweaks and optimizations that they
combined to eke out more performance. I just substituted the constants they
arrived at, but performance could likely be improved by tweaking these for my
particular setup (processor, cache size, etc.).

## Note to the Grader

In closing, I wanted to take the time to thank you (the course staff) for all
your hard work. From one TA to another, I have an idea of how much work is
involved in running a course, but I can only imagine how much more there is when
rearchitecting a course from scratch.

I can without a doubt say that I got everything out of this course that I wanted
to. I have so much more of an understanding of graphics programming, graphical
algorithms, differential calculus, linear algebra, and more just from taking
this course, and I can tell it's the kind of knowledge that I won't forget
easily. This simply wouldn't have been the case without such a great course
staff.

Thank you so much for all your work! I had tons of fun this semester.

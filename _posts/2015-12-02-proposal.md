For the final project, I'll be working on accelerating BVH construction from
the ray tracer in assignment 3. I'll try implementing the algorithm for
Approximate Agglomerate Clustering proposed by the paper linked from the project
ideas page.

The steps are outlined pretty clearly in this paper. I'll start by implementing
the algorithm in a single threaded manner. This will serve to ensure that I've
interpreted the core algorithm correctly.

Moving on from this step, I'll extend the assignment to use OpenMP for
parallelizing the algorithm. Using OpenMP should allow for minimal code changes
to get good performance, because the algorithm itself is recursive. At this step
I'll get to start seeing some of the parallel speedups from implementing this
bounding box.

Time permitting, it would be interesting to try one or both of the following
things:

- Try implementing the algorithm linked in the second paper on the project ideas
  page. It would be interesting to compare these two algorithms for performance
  of construction and time spent ray tracing.
- Profile one or both of these implementations to see how much speed we can get
  out of this algorithm. This could involve interesting data structures,
  efficient use of locality, elimination of excess sequential work, etc.
